# OpenCV Basics

## 📘 Overview

This repository presents a structured and academically oriented collection of Jupyter notebooks implementing fundamental and intermediate concepts of **Computer Vision** using the **OpenCV** library in Python. The primary objective of this work is to provide practical implementation of image processing, feature analysis, and sequential modeling techniques that are commonly studied in undergraduate and early graduate computer vision courses.

The repository is suitable for academic coursework, laboratory sessions, independent study, and as a foundation for research-oriented or applied computer vision projects.
